# QES Risk Model Format

QES Risk model files are outputed by the Custom model generator service. The files are generated for each date and columns and format of the file depends on the template specified. For more information on QES Risk Model service [see our page on Github](https://github.com/wolferesearch/docs/tree/master/micro-services)

The files can be downloaded locally and can be used for commercial optimizer. Please contact us in case you need assistance with incorporating custom risk model files with a third-party optimizer. 

## Model File Details

## File Types
- Factor Covariance (.cov)
- Factor Exposure (.exp)
- Identity File (.idm)
- Security Covariance File (.isc)
- Specific Risk File (.rsk)
- Factor Returns File (.rtn)

### File Naming
Files are organized by dates. The file gets its name by combining the following 3 entries. 
- Model : template.options.model
- Region: template.options.region
- Date : yyyymmdd
- 
File is named as <Region>_<Model>_<Date>.<File Type Extension>

For example, Factor Covariance file will get naming for Model M1, for US region on 31-Dec-2018 will be named US_M1_20181231.cov. 

### Factor Covariance (.cov file)

This file contains the covariance between factors on a particular day.
Format Requirements:
1. Row 1 - Contains factor name or mnemonic
2. Column A - Contains factor name or mnemonic
3. For any row, column pair, the diagonal terms are variances and the off diagonal terms are covariances.
The units are in decimal covariance units. The matrix is symmetric

### Identity File (.idm file)
File contains reference data for security
1. ID - Contains id of the security
2. Sedol - SEDOL
3. Ticker - Ticker
4. Company Name
5. Sector
6. Industry Group
7. Currency
8. IssuerId (Internal)

### Factor Exposure (.exp file)
File contains exposure of each security in the universe
1. ID - Contains security Id 
2. <Factor Names> -  From second column onwards columns based on the factor. The exposure file can be combined with the factor covariance file in order to build the covariance matrix. 

### Specific Risk File (.rsk file)
File contains idiosyncratic risk for the securities
1. ID - Contains security Id
2. Specific Risk - Annualized risk in percentage units.


### Factor Returns (.rtn file)
This file contains the period and cumulative return of each factor on a particular day.
1. FactorName - name of factor as defined in factor metadata file
2. Return - the one day factor return in percent units.
3. CumulativeReturn - the cumulative factor return in percent units.


### Security Covariance (.isc file)
This file contains the non-zero issuer specific covariances on a particular day.
1. SecurityID - SecurityID of the first security
2. SecurityID - SecurityID of the second security
3. Covariance - covariance between the two securities in decimal units.

### Meta File (.meta file)
This file is providede for information purpose and combines the idm file along with exposure file with a few additional attributes. 
SECURITY FILES
Daily Security Metadata
This file contains the all the securities information including: identifier metadata, exposures, and risk on a particular
day.
Format Requirements:
1. Ticker - ticker symbol
3. A unique identifier that tracks the same company even when other identifiers change
4. CUSIP
5. ISIN
6. Description - description of the security
7. AssetClass (Optional) - description of the asset class such as stock or ETF
8. Country - 2 letter ISO format for the country where the security trades
9. Currency - 3 letter ISO format for the currency in which the security trades
10. ExchangeRate - Exchange rate to USD
11. 20DayADV - 20 day average trading value in local currency (must be split adjusted)
12. Price - End of day price in local currency (NOT split adjusted)
13. 1DayReturn - one day return in percent units (must be split adjusted)
14. TotalRisk - total risk in annualized percent units
15. SpecificRisk - specific risk in annualized percent units
16. <Factor_Name> - security exposure to the factor
